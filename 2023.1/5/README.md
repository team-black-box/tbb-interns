# Frontend Developer

### **About Me**

Hello, my name is Yahaya Muhammad Bello.
I am a Frontend Developer by profession and writer by hobby. I choose my profession because I have always been so curious and wondering that if common website will have a database, then where is the database for whole internet itself. And that led me to web development where I finally found my answer, but I have already gone so deep, so I decided to keep moving and go even deeper.

I like to read self-development books and I always have a good book on the go at any time. In December 2022, I developed a passion for writing articles about what I have learned, and as of January, 2023, I have written 19 self-development articles. I started writing these articles because I feel I have learned something thatâ€™s worth sharing.
