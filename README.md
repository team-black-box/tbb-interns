# TBB Interns

Welcome to TBB Interns repository - the repository for hosting a page that talks about you. Feel free to make it yours. Here's how to get started

1. Clone this repository
2. Add a file under the right folder with the name <intern-number>.md - we have one folder per intern batch!
3. Once you are happy with the contents of your page - submit an MR
4. TBB Admin team will review it and then merge it
5. Once merged your page will be live on the tbb website - https://teamblackbox.in

# Note

Your page will have a predefined header which will look like the following:
