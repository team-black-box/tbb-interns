# TBB Interns

Welcome to TBB Interns repository - the repository for hosting a page that talks about you. Feel free to make it yours. Here's how to get started

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a folder with name as your intern number, under the top level internship batch folder - for example if you are Intern #5 in our 2023.1 batch, you should create a folder called 5 inside the 2023.1 folder.
3. Inside your folder create another folder called assets and a file called README.md - Fill up the README.md file with content that talks about you! and you can use images from the assets folder
4. TBB Admin team will review the content and images will be checked for copyright infringement and then merge it
5. Once merged your page will be live on the tbb website - https://teamblackbox.in

# Note

Your page will have a predefined header which will look like the following:
