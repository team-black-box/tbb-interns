# Frontend Developer

My name is Yahaya Muhammad Bello and thank you for taking your time to check my profile. I have been web developer for the past 4 years, to avoid being jack-of-all-trade I narrow down option for myself and specialize in Frontend Development with React. I am someone who is always seeking to learn and develop, outside of work I keep myself fit and active; I am a positive person who always embraces change, and I always take responsibility for my own professional development.
